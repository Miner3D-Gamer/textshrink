A minimalistic lib that reduces text size by replacing specific character sequences with single Unicode characters.
On average, this compresses text by ~5%, with variation also ~5%.

One neat feature of this lib: * and ° look pretty similar yet usually only °C would be convertable into ℃, using aliases this limitation is no more as *C, ˚C, ᴼC, and ºC, will all be replaceable by ℃
